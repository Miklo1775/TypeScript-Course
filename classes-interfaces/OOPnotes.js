// OOP is working with real life based entities in code.
//in Max's course, a ProductList object is in charge of fetching a list of products and rendering them to the screen

//the products being fetched are in charge of rendering the details of the product and allows that product to be added to a cart

//the shopping cart would be in charge of rendering all the products in it, the totals, and also the logic to ordering said products

// Classes and Instances

//Objects are the things you work with in code. They store the data, methods and whatnots.
//Classes are essentially the blueprints for how an object should look.

//If an object is based on a class, we call that an instance of the class.

//A class determines what methods and properties that an object will have

//Classes simplify the way of creating multiple and similar objects
